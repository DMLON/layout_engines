## Personal Opinion

In my opinion PUG is superior to the other frameworks because it has Python-like syntax as well as SASS syntax which i use on the everyday.
I like the fact that not so many symbols are needed to call js code.
Thou migrating to PUG from HTML code is annoying.

The syntax of EJS is like PHP, kinda of confusing as well as not having layouts in its core, so another library must be installed. 
Also having to close the foreach brackets after using them on many lines below... Very prone to error.

Handlebars looks very primitive, similar to EJS it shares the same syntax as HTML which make migrating code easy. In part is superior to EJS because of having layouts built-in, as well as partials.

### Conclusion

PUG > Handlebars > EJS
